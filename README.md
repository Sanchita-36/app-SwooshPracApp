# app-SwooshPracApp
This app has been built as a practice app learnt from a course. 
It basically shows how the elements should be designed, how we can use 'segue', buttons, labels, 
designed the buttons under 'Model' group.

Configurations: 
Swift 5, Xcode version: 11.5 , MacOS version: 10.15.7

How it works:
On launching the App, click on 'GET STARTED' button -> Select one of the Desired League and click on 'NEXT' button,
-> The selected Desired League will be displayed in a label on the next view controller, 
-> You can select any of the two buttons on the last view controller and the selected data wouldd get 
displayed on a label on the same page. -> You can click 'Finish' button and go bac to the first view controller. 
In the two view controllers I have added a button 'Arrow' to go to previous pages.


I am still a learner trying to build good applications and get good understanding of iOS Development.
